# ouya-dev-resource-backup
A selection of resources for OUYA developers from the soon-to-be-defunct ouya.tv website and other sites, in-case a hobbyist community emerges from the OUYA shutdown after June 25th 2019.

Button prompt images are taken from https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/articles/how-to-learn-ouya-gamedev--gamedev-9197 which provides a detailed, albeit outdated information about the OUYA console for developers.

Razer still owns the rights to the OUYA and Forge TV brands. I am not asserting ownership over any of these, just a desire to archive these resources. The official OUYA GitHub profile is https://github.com/ouya
